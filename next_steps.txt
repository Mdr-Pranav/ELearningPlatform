Based on what's been implemented so far (authentication system, role-based navigation, profile page), the immediate next steps should focus on the core functionality of the platform:
Course Management System:
Create course listing/discovery page that displays available courses
Implement course detail view with enrollment options
Build course creation interface for instructors
Dashboard Development:
Complete student dashboard showing enrolled courses and progress
Finish instructor dashboard with course management tools
API Integration:
Implement the remaining API endpoints for courses:
GET /api/courses (listing)
GET /api/courses/{id} (details)
POST /api/courses (creation for instructors)
GET /api/enrollments/user/{userId} (student enrollments)
Content Management:
Create components for displaying course materials
Build the content upload tools for instructors
Start with a simple course card component that can be reused across the platform, then build the course listing page. This establishes the foundation for enrollment features and content delivery which are core to the platform's functionality.
